## Notes
The location parsing system works by taking in an indeterminite number of location verbs, where each verb has a single character (case insensative) followed by a number. To aid in visualizing the structure of location codes, the `-` symbol can be used to separate verbs. This separator is optional.

The dev server will run on address `192.168.10.210`. The production server will run on address `192.168.10.200`.
